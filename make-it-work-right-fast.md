        To prevent analysis paralysis, follow these simple steps in
        case a problem seems too big to tackle. First simply make it
        work. Second, make it right, by making your code compliant
        with craftsmanship principles. Finally, make it fast if really
        needed.

### Motivation

To prevent analysis paralysis, follow these simple steps in case a problem seems too big to tackle.

First, simply make it work. Don't pay (much) attention to craftsmanship principles such as [dry](dry-principle).

Second, make it right, by making your code compliant with craftsmanship principles.

Finally, make it fast if really needed.
